Congratulations! You are on the main page of my personal analyst database. My name is [Nikolay Baakh](https://github.com/BaakhOfficial), I am a Data Analyst. But here you can find much more than just Data Analyst stuff.



It's a copy of my thoughts. You can call it a book if you want. Here I'll formalize my knowledge about stuff. It will be my ethernet imprint that someone maybe will see once

I can make a lot of links, but it will turn everything into mess. I want it to be quite linear with some additional information

Here you can find [[Table of contents]] if you are want to find something specific.

www.markdownguide.org - really recommend
[Definitive Obsidian Markdown Cheatsheet: Complete Syntax Reference - Face Dragons](https://facedragons.com/personal-development/obsidian-markdown-cheatsheet/#tables) - also can be useful
