## Skin type

First - you should understand your skin type. **Even if in your opinion you know** which skin you have - check it. I've thought that I have oily skin bc of acne and blackheads. Turns out I have dry skin. Lol

### Characteristics of the four main skin types:

1.  **Normal skin:** If you have normal skin, your skin is well-balanced and generally clear with small pores. It's not too dry or too oily, and it's not sensitive to most skincare products.
    
2.  **Oily skin:** If you have oily skin, your skin tends to produce more sebum, which can lead to clogged pores, blackheads, and acne. Your skin may appear shiny, particularly in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin).
    
3.  **Dry skin: I**f you have dry skin, your skin produces less sebum, which can lead to flakiness, roughness, and tightness. Your skin may also appear dull and have visible fine lines and wrinkles.
    
4.  **Combination skin:** If you have combination skin, your skin is a mix of oily and dry, with an oily T-zone and drier cheeks.

### How to know your skin type

To determine your skin type, wash your face with a gentle cleanser and then wait for an hour without applying any skincare products. Observe how your skin feels and looks:

-   If your skin feels balanced, not too dry or oily, and looks clear, you likely have normal skin.
-   If your skin feels greasy or looks shiny, particularly in the T-zone, you may have oily skin.
-   If your skin feels tight, itchy, or looks flaky, you may have dry skin.
-   If your T-zone is oily but the rest of your face is dry, you may have combination skin.

Once you know your skin type, you can choose skincare products that are specifically formulated for your skin type and concerns.

## Routines

Wait at least 1-2 minutes between each step to allow the product to fully absorb before applying the next product. 5-10 minutes will be even better

When shopping for skincare products, look for those that are specifically formulated for your skin and are free of harsh chemicals and fragrances that can irritate your skin. If you have a dry skin - consider purchasing products that contain natural ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, and jojoba oil, which can help hydrate and soothe dry skin.

When it comes to shaving accessories, invest in a high-quality razor with sharp blades to help prevent irritation and razor burn. Always use shaving cream or gel to protect your skin while shaving, and be sure to rinse your razor frequently to prevent clogging. After shaving, rinse your face with cool water and apply a moisturizing aftershave lotion or balm to soothe your skin.

For your daily skincare routine, you can apply the products every 5-10 minutes in between to allow each product to absorb properly into your skin. However, it's important to listen to your skin and adjust the frequency and order of your routine based on its specific needs.

### Morning Routine:

1.  **Gentle Cleanser:** Look for a gentle, hydrating cleanser that won't strip your skin of its natural oils.
