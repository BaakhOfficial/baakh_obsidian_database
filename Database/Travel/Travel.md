My experience will not be universal for everyone. But maybe for someone it will be useful

## Documents

| Type of document | Why |
| --- | ---|
| Birth Certificate | If you want to get some type of residence permit - can be useful |
| Police clearance Certificate | Same thing. Useful for residence |
| Documents on Education | You will need them for a lot of things. Mainly for Visas and Employment/Education |
| Marriage Certificate | If you are married - you know why you need this. |
| Notarized power of attorney | If you will forget something (AND YOU WILL) - you can ask person with that paper to do something without leaving your new country. |
| Pet's paperwork | Can't help you with that tbh. Never had a pet, but if you want to move with it - you need it |

## Why residence permit?

> I think that emigrate without it is quite risky if you don't want to come back. You can't get a lot of things without it, like visa for new country or

Btw. Apostile everything you can. I had no such possibility so will talk about my experience without it
