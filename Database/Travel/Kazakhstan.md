## TRP through employment 

>*Technically you are creating a business, but they are suggest that you work on KZ legal entity*

For Russians it is very easy. I'm sure that a lot of people will find it useful even if you are not from Russia.^[Also check [that](https://relocation.guide/kazakhstan) page if you are from Russia]

That's the way I've chosen in details:

### Here you have not entered Kazakhstan 
--- 
1. Get EDS, IIN in your country. For that find Embassy of Kazakhstan and do it in there
2. Get a Police clearance certificate.
3. Get some Tenge in cash. Always will be useful
4. If you are from Russia - get UnionPay card and MIR card SEPARATELY
5. Find a hotel/hostel for yourself

### We entered Kazakhstan
---
1.  In your hostel get [Eqonak](https://eqonaq.kz/) (notice of arrival)^[Found that information [here](https://astanahub.com/media/%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D0%BE_%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8E.docx.pdf)]
2. Buy a Sim-Card. You might need some additional documents.
3. Get a card. Easiest - Kaspi Gold.^[That information and more i've got [here](https://vc.ru/migrate/414510-kak-ya-registriroval-kompaniyu-v-kazahstane-i-poluchal-karty-kak-fiz-i-yur-lico-za-5-dney)] You might need some additional documents. Russians need SNILS
4. Add all possible information to your IIN. For example - passport of your country and Police clearance sertificate.

### Creating a legal entity^[A lot of info in details [here](https://mybuh.kz/useful/kak-zaregistrirovat-too-v-kazakhstane-i-kakie-dokumenty-potrebuyutsya.html)]

1. You need to rent a place.
