## Foreword

>*Congratulations! You are on the main page of my personal analyst database. My name is [Nikolay Baakh](https://github.com/BaakhOfficial), I am a Data Analyst. But here you can find much more than just Data Analyst stuff.*

**Some links lead to Russian books or websites. They are marked with #Russian  hashtag**

If I will decide that one page of that database is very cool - I will duplicate it in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@baakhofficial) blog

Work is still in progress, it's not even alpha version. So sry if something here is not detailed or impressive.

It's a copy of my thoughts. You can call it a book if you want. Here I'll formalize my knowledge about stuff. It will be my ethernet imprint that someone maybe will see once

I can make a lot of links, but it will turn everything into mess. I want it to be quite linear with some additional information

## Table of contents:
