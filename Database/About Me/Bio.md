## <6 yrs: Taste of life
---
&emsp; 1997-08-10. I've been born in a small Russian city in Siberia, in quite a poor family. From memories of my mother there were a days, when she absolutely had no food for me and my small brother. She told me with tears one moment, that imprinted in my memory.  

&emsp; We came to the kitchen and told her that we want to eat. She had absolutely nothing and no money. She cried in despair. But then found a man, that held father's salary due to crisis and defended our rights. In a lot of ways she is my hero.  

&emsp; Idk where exactly in that period, but my parents got tired of that miserable life and decided to create a business based on skills of my father. One thing to another and we are quite rich in our city. I had Nintendo, Sega, Playstation 1, PC, when no one else had. Our family had 3 cars and a driver.  

&emsp; **It was a moment. when I've got a taste of life. Taste of something outside of my small scary town. Time when I've fell in love with Tech.**

&emsp; Than out of nowhere dad started to drink.

&emsp; You should understand that I'm vaguely remember that period. Idk where exactly all that happened and can be off on some years, but everything slowly went downhill. Father rarely was sober and could be lost for a weeks. He spent money like he was a richest man on earth. Stopped to work with big contractors because he was drunk. Literally sent them to hell. He could buy a drinks for the whole bar. He lived in a movie. In his dream.  

&emsp; Of course it hasn't lasted for long. Problems built up, father ran down the bottle. He literally sometimes promised to kill our mother and hit her with an iron door. I've had some scariest nights of my life that imprinted in me forever.  

I could talk about that period for a long time, but that's not so important.
