## Brief details:

My name is Baakh Nikolay.
Born in 1997 in small town in the Syberia. Calculate my age by yourself =D

I've been through quite a lot in my opinion. Not too much, not too little. Just enough to be myself. Right now on 2023/02/25 pursue career as a Data Analyst with no experience, but a lot of passion and paid courses. You can check my [[CV]] if you want

I've been working as a salesman, consultant, SMM, marketer, enterpreneur, beatmaker and even as a bartender. It's  jobs I've been paid for, not just "I am identify myself as..." jobs.

If you are interested in detailed information about my life - you can find it in [[Bio]]. I promise to be as transparent as I can. But every person should needs it's secrets.

Of course check my socials and ask me anything. You can find all that in my [[Contact Info]] page.
