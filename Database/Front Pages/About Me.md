I've been working as a salesman, consultant, SMM, marketer, entrepreneur, beatmaker and even as a bartender. It's  jobs I've been paid for, not just "I am identify myself as..." jobs.

I promise to be as transparent as I can. But every person should needs it's secrets.

Of course check my socials and ask me anything. You can find all that in my [[Contact Info]] page.
